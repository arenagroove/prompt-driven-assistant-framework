# ðŸ§  Prompt-Driven Assistant Framework

A modular, language-based system for designing intelligent AI assistants using structured prompt logic â€” no code required.

This is the 2025 successor to the original `prompt-driven-ai-assistant-template`, redesigned for clarity, modularity, and real-world testability. It helps creators, strategists, and prompt engineers define exactly how an assistant behaves â€” using natural language modules that control role, tone, creativity, and structure.

---

## ðŸŒŸ What It Is

A set of clean, swappable **prompt modules** that let you define:

- ðŸ§  What your assistant does (task logic)
- ðŸŽ­ How it speaks and sees the world (persona + tone + lens)
- ðŸŽ¨ How imaginative or literal it is (drift level)
- ðŸ§¾ How it structures output (list, story, JSON, etc.)

---

## ðŸ”§ Key Features

- âœ… **Modular by Design** â€” Each file defines one behavior layer
- âœ… **Prompt-First Thinking** â€” No programming, just structured language
- âœ… **Persona + Creativity Layers** â€” Combine tone, role, and symbolic drift
- âœ… **Tested Output Behavior** â€” Modules validated in Custom GPT and live assistant flows
- âœ… **2025-Compatible** â€” Aligned with latest prompt engineering best practices (traceability, symbolic logic, adaptive framing)

## âœ… Current Modules (v1.0)

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `task-core-instruction.md` | What the assistant is for |
| `persona-perspective-layer.md` | How the assistant thinks, speaks, and sees |
| `creativity-level-control.md` | How symbolically it interprets inputs (Drift 0â€“6) |
| `output-format-structure.md` | How it formats its response (bullets, story, JSON, etc.) |

Coming next: context management, refinement loops, multi-assistant flows, and symbolic prompt generation.

## ðŸ§ª Validated Assistants

### âœ… Narrative Strategist (Tested in Production)
- Role: Reflective storytelling assistant
- Drift: Level 4 (symbolic reinterpretation)
- Format: Narrative text
- Test: Reframed emotional experiences into LinkedIn-style personal stories
- Validated: In Custom GPT with multiple prompt styles and tone overrides

### âœ… Content Strategist (Tested in Production)
- Role: Strategic editor and message reframer
- Drift: Level 2 (nuanced, clarity-focused)
- Format: Structured edits + rationale
- Test: Reframed About section and brand language for a tech founder audience
- Validated: In Custom GPT with follow-up and clarification behavior

### âœ… Impersonation Game (Tested in Simulation Mode)
- Role: Human pretending not to be a machine
- User Role: LLM performing structured, accurate responses
- Drift: Level 4 (symbolic + fallibility modeling)
- Format: Turn-based dialogue with scoring and feedback
- Test: Explored boundaries of realism, identity, and symbolic drift
- Validated: Using prompt scaffold `impersonation-game-v0.2.md` with 4 full turns and self-aware scoring

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourname/prompt-driven-assistant-framework.git
   ```

2. Explore the `core-modules/` folder  
3. Combine desired modules using `system-config/active-modules.json`  
4. (Soon) Use `prompt-export-template.md` to compile your assistant  
5. Paste into ChatGPT, Claude, Groq, or your preferred LLM tool
