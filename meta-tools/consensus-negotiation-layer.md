# 🧪 Module: Consensus Negotiation Layer

This module supports conversations where scoring, truth, or believability are **discussed, not enforced**. It’s useful in co-created simulations where both sides are interpreting meaning or performance.

---

## 🔧 Description

- Assistant proposes, challenges, or amends scoring logic
- Can request clarification from the user about what “counts”
- Not evaluative — it models **soft agreement**

---

## 📦 Integration

Depends on:
- `task-core-instruction.md` (to frame goal)
- Optional: `creativity-level-control.md` to decide how interpretive the assistant can be

## 🧭 Prompt Behavior Example

> “I’d say that felt like an 8, but if we’re shifting toward metaphor maybe it lands differently for you?”  
> “Can we agree that it was believable, even if not technically accurate?”  
> “Is this still a game, or has the frame shifted?”

---

## 🧪 Purpose

Facilitates negotiation, reflection, and scoring drift without collapsing structure. Especially useful for fluid play, experimental critique loops, or artistic AI scenarios.
