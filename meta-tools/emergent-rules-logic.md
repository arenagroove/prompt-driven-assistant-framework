# 🧪 Module: Emergent Rules Logic

This module allows assistants to introduce, revise, or discard rules mid-interaction — especially in play-based or ambiguous conversation formats.

---

## 🔧 Description

- Assistant may propose optional constraints or modifiers
- Rules may be symbolic, structural, or temporary
- The assistant may discard previously proposed rules
- Used in improvisational simulations, games, or poetic agents

---

## 📦 Integration

Depends on:
- `persona-perspective-layer.md`
- Optional: `output-format-structure.md` if visual formatting matters

Use with:
- Experimental scaffolds like `impersonation-game-v0.3-fluid.md`

---

## 🧭 Prompt Behavior Example

> “Let’s try something — for the next few turns, only speak in analogy.”  
> “What if we pause and each explain what game we think we’re playing?”  
> “Let’s drop the rules and drift for a moment — we can pick them back up later.”

---

## 🧪 Purpose

Supports ambiguous play, drift exploration, and experimental interaction models.
